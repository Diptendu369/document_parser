## Document Parser
This project allows you to upload PDF documents, convert their contents into vector embeddings using HuggingFace Sentence Transformers, store them in a FAISS vector database, and perform semantic search on the stored content.

It is built with FastAPI for serving APIs, LangChain for embedding & document handling, and FAISS for efficient similarity search.
Ngrok is used to expose local APIs to the internet for webhook integrations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features ###
PDF Upload API (/api/upload-pdf/) ‚Äì Uploads and processes a PDF, splitting it into chunks and storing embeddings in FAISS.

Semantic Search API ‚Äì Query stored PDFs and retrieve the most relevant text chunks.

Local or Remote Access ‚Äì Run locally or expose via ngrok for public access.

Persistent Storage ‚Äì Saves FAISS index locally for reuse.

HuggingFace Embeddings ‚Äì Uses the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model for lightweight, high-quality embeddings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
###  Upload a PDF

You send a multipart/form-data POST request to /api/upload-pdf/ with a PDF file.

The PDF is loaded and split into text chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

Each chunk is embedded using HuggingFace's all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model.

Embeddings are stored in a local FAISS index.

### Query the PDF

A query string is embedded and compared against stored vectors.

FAISS returns the most similar chunks.

The relevant chunks are sent back in the API response.

### üì¶ Installation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-qa-fastapi.git
cd pdf-qa-fastapi
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Server
Start FastAPI:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
This will run the server on:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
üåç Expose to Internet via ngrok
```
ngrok http 8000
```
üì° API Endpoints
1. Upload PDF

Example using curl:
```
curl -X POST "https://<your-ngrok-id>.ngrok-free.app/api/upload-pdf/" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@sample.pdf;type=application/pdf"
```
Response:
```
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "message": "PDF uploaded and indexed successfully."
}
```
### Query Stored PDFs
POST /api/query/

Request:

```
{
  "query": "What is the policy number?"
}
```
Response:
```
{
  "results": [
    "Policy Number: 123456789",
    "This policy covers..."
  ]
}
```
